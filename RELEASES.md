# Next Version (unreleased)

cargo-dist:

* Added proper detection of README/LICENSE/RELEASES/CHANGELOG files, which are now copied to the root of executable-zips.
    * We will defer to Cargo fields like "readme" and "license-file" if present
    * Otherwise we will search the root directory of the package and the root directory of the workspace (preferring results from the former)
* Release note handling:
    * --ci=github will manually set the title and body of the Github Release
    * The body is a generated listing of installers/downloads
    * If your RELEASES/CHANGELOG parses with parse_changelog library we'll append the current release's notes to the body, and use the heading for the title
    * If we don't parse your RELEASES/CHANGELOG we will default to a title of "v{VERSION}"

cargo-dist-schema:

* Changed PathBufs to Strings since the paths may be from a different OS and Rust Paths are generally platform-specific. Seemed like a ticking timebomb for some weird corner case.
* Added "changelog" as a valid AssetKind
* Added "changelog_title" and "changelog_body" to Release
    * These are used to populate a Github Release
* Added "description" to Artifact
    * Currently just used to describe some installers
    
# Version 0.0.1 (2023-01-23)

This is the first alpha release of cargo-dist with some minimal functionality!

There are also a couple 0.0.1 prereleases that came before this one that exist to define a sort of "bootstrapping history" for the first "real" release's binary builds because I find it vaguely satisfying and you can't stop me.
